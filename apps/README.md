# Apps Layer

Add application frontends or backend gateways under this directory. Example structure:

- `apps/web` – primary web client (Next.js, Vite, etc.).
- `apps/api` – backend or BFF service colocated with the contracts.

Create additional folders (e.g., `apps/mobile`) as needed. Keep each app self-contained with its own package manager config, env templates, and deployment notes.
