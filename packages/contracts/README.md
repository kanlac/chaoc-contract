# Contracts Package

This folder hosts the Foundry workspace for the reputation system smart contracts.

- Solidity sources live under `src/`.
- Tests and fixtures live under `test/`.
- Deployment and smoke scripts live under `script/`.
- Compiled artefacts and deploy traces stay within `out/` and `broadcast/`.

Commands can be executed from the repo root (e.g., `forge test`, `make build`) because `foundry.toml` has been updated to point into this package.
